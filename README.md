# DSTS_Final_Project

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of flight delays based on weather conditions and other factors, designed to improve customer experience on a travel booking website. 

**Project Overview**
**Objective**
The objective is to build a predictive model that can estimate the probability of flight delays at major U.S. airports, using historical data. This model can enable the travel website to inform customers about potential delays when booking flights, enhancing customer satisfaction and decision-making.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset includes data on domestic flights between 2014 and 2018. Each CSV file in the dataset contains information about the scheduled and actual departure and arrival times for flights from the busiest U.S. airports, along with weather data. The data has been gathered by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and consists of 60 compressed files, each representing one monthâ€™s data over the five-year period.

The data can be downloaded from this link: [https://ucstaff-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ibrahim_radwan_canberra_edu_au/Er0nVreXmihEmtMz5qC5kVIB81-ugSusExPYdcyQTglfLg?e=bNO312]. Please download the data files and place them on the **zipFile** folder
